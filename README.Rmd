With {tabularise} you should be able to obtain publication-ready (rich-formatted) tabular output from different R objects. It uses and enhances the excellent {flextable} package to build these tables and allow to output them in HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word or PowerPoint.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {tabularise} from the [r-universe/sciviews](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev) or [GitHub](https://github.com/)

-   [r-universe/sciviews](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tabularise", repos = "https://sciviews.r-universe.dev")
```

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SciViews/tabularise")
```

## Short example

Let's take the well-known iris dataframe, to which we add labels and units.

```{r}
data("iris")

# add labels and units
iris <- data.io::labelise(iris,
  label = list(
    Sepal.Length = "Length of the sepals", Sepal.Width = "Width of the sepals",
    Petal.Length  = "Length of the petals", Petal.Width = "Width of the petals", 
    Species  = "Iris species"),
  units = list(
    Sepal.Length = "cm", Sepal.Width = "cm", 
    Petal.Length  = "cm", Petal.Width = "cm"))
```

Once the labels and units have been added to our initial data, tabularise will use them to display publication-ready (rich-formatted) tabular output.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tabularise)
tabularise$headtail(iris) # or tabularise(iris, type = "headtail")
```

{tabularise} is a central package on which several other packages in the SciViews universe. Numerous methods are available for {tabularise} and they are further enhanced by other packages, such as {[modelit](https://www.sciviews.org/modelit/)}.
