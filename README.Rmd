With {tabularise} you should be able to obtain publication-ready (rich-formatted) tabular output from different R objects. It uses and enhances the {flextable} package to build these tables and allow to output them in HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word or PowerPoint. See <https://www.sciviews.org/tabularise> for more details.

## Installation

{tabularise} is not available from CRAN yet. You should install it from the [SciViews R-Universe](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev). The {equatags} and {equatiomatic} packages are optional, but they are useful to display equations, both inline in R Markdown/Quarto documents and in {tabularise} tables. The {svBase} package is useful too because it manages labels and units that {chart} uses. To install those three packages and their dependencies, run the following command in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('tabularise', 'equatags', 'equatiomatic', 'svBase'),
  repos = c('https://sciviews.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

You can also install the latest development version of {tabularise}. Make sure you have the {remotes} R package installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SciViews/tabularise")
```

## Short example

Let's take the well-known `iris` data frame, to which we add labels and units.

```{r}
data("iris")

# Add labels and units
iris <- svBase::labelise(iris,
  label = list(
    Sepal.Length = "Sepal length", Sepal.Width = "Sepal width",
    Petal.Length  = "Petal length", Petal.Width = "Petal width", 
    Species  = "Iris species"),
  units = list(
    Sepal.Length = "cm", Sepal.Width = "cm",
    Petal.Length  = "cm", Petal.Width = "cm"))
```

Once the labels and units have been added to our data frame, the `tabularise()` function uses them automatically in the tables it produces.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tabularise)
tabularise$headtail(iris) # or tabularise(iris, type = "headtail")
```

{tabularise} is a central package used by several other packages in the SciViews universe to format its tabular outputs. Various methods are available for `tabularise()` and they are further enhanced by other packages, such as [{inferit}](https://www.sciviews.org/inferit/) and [{modelit}](https://www.sciviews.org/modelit/).
