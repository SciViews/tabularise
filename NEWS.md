# tabularise 0.1.0

-   Tables generated by `tabularise()` now "autofit" columns by default.

-   Reasonable defaults are set up on package loading for {flextable} (non-breaking space for big.mark, and Arial 12 for the font)

-   Caption is set from tab-cap chunk options (both for Quarto and R Markdown documents).

# tabularise 0.0.0.9000

-   First development version of the package.
